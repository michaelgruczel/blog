a simple comparison of ClickHouse to relational Databases.

**Row based**

The most relational databases are row based. So you could say a table contains rows of data, whereas each row cotain multiple columns.
The normal pattern is request all columns for a single or multiple rows.

| id | name    | last_name |
| -- | ------- | --------- |
| 1  | John    | Doe       |
| 2  | Jane    | Dane      |
| 3  | Carl    | Cone      |
| 4  | Daniela | Dobbs     |

Row-oriented databases are ideal for some access patterns, specifically transactional processing, while column-oriented databases are better suited for analytical processing. Transactional queries (or OLTP, Online Transaction Processing) that read and write just a few rows per query and, therefore, complete in milliseconds, analytics queries routinely process billions and trillions of rows.

**Column based**

In a columnn based database a table coltain all values of a single column. Each column of the table is located one after the other. In this orientation, values on the same column are close in space.

| 1  | 2 | 3   | 4 |
| ---- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| John | Jane   | Carl | Daniela |
| Doe  | Dane   | Cone | Dobbs   |

The column-based approach is preferable for executing analytics queries that aggregate or filter a few columns, especially when working with large datasets. Analytics, also known as OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), refers to SQL queries with complex calculations (e.g., aggregations, string processing, arithmetic) over massive datasets.

**Clickhouse and SQL**

ClickHouse is a column-oriented SQL database management system (DBMS). It is available as both an open-source software and a cloud offering.

ClickHouse supports a declarative query language based on SQL that is identical to the ANSI SQL standard in many cases. Supported query clauses include GROUP BY, ORDER BY, subqueries in FROM, JOIN clause, IN operator, window functions and scalar subqueries.

One not prod ready way to imstall the open source version:

```shell
curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh
./clickhouse
./clickhouse server
./clickhouse client
```

sample data handling

```
CREATE TABLE my_first_table
(
    user_id UInt32,
    message String,
    timestamp DateTime,
    metric Float32
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, timestamp)

INSERT INTO my_first_table (user_id, message, timestamp, metric) VALUES
    (101, 'Hello, ClickHouse!',                                 now(),       -1.0    ),
    (102, 'Insert a lot of rows per batch',                     yesterday(), 1.41421 ),
    (102, 'Sort your data based on your commonly-used queries', today(),     2.718   ),
    (101, 'Granules are the smallest chunks of data read',      now() + 5,   3.14159 )

SELECT *
FROM my_first_table
ORDER BY timestamp
```

**Clickhouse data integration**

One powerfull feature of clickhouse is that it allows the import native of existing databases and storage solutions. So you can import archived data from S3, Web, Postgres, brokers (Amazon MSK, Rabbit MQ, Kafka), Datalakes (Iceberg, Hadoop, Hudi, DeltaLake) or others.

Use the client or a console on https://localhost:8443/play

```

**sum up**

without going into details, Clickhouse seem to be very attractive for new data processing projects, since

- open source supported
- very fast for column based access and analytical queries on some columns
- very fast and efficient
- a lot of integrations into UI, clients, programming languages, storages
